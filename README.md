# neural-networks
Using contact information in Salesforce such as relationship to the college, past giving, event attendance, 
contact reports, and many more features, I was able to predict how much someone would give to my college in the next year.

In order to have a better understanding of the math behind neural networks, I decided not to use any machine learning libraries.
I started with a basic XOR neural network and worked my way up to more advanced networks with more layers.
