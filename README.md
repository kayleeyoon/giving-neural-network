# neural-networks
Using contact information in Salesforce such as relationship to the college, past giving, event attendance, 
contact reports, and many more features, I was able to predict how much someone would give to my college in the next year.

In order to have a better understanding of the math behind neural networks, I decided not to use any machine learning libraries.
I started with a basic XOR neural network, then worked on a neural network that classified emails as spam or not spam.  

Once I had a good understanding of neural networks, I began my real challenge of using the real data from my college to predict 
donor giving.  Once I built by base model, I tested using more layers to find the optimal network for my task.

The bulk of my work was on understanding backpropagation as well as how to transform the data into values the network could learn on.
